#IPL Auctioning System
This was my Database Management System Term Project. The system can be used during the auctioning of Indian Premiere League. It contains the data of all the teams that are a part of IPL and individual players as well.

##Features
* The data was crawled from [IPL Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League) & [IPL official website](www.iplt20.com/).
* The data was modelled to answer various queries pertaining to player or team.
* The [presentation](https://github.com/studanshu/IPL/blob/master/ipl_auction.pptx) contains the ER diagram that we used for our model. The tables that we defined and various queries that can be asked.

##Requirements
* [NetBeans 8.0.2+](http://netbeans.org/)
* [Java SDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
